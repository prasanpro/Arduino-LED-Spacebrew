# Arduino-LED-Spacebrew
Arduino LED control over processing slider

After going through Space Brew, an open source initiative for interactive installation, I thought to make something interesting out of it. I want to make a projection project which interacts with accelerometer. 

I started the project with first tweaking with the code and what I already knew. I like the spacebrew range example and throught to control the brightness of LED according to the current position of slider position.

There are two codes uploaded in this repository dated 17th August, 2015 for initial test. Please follow my blog for detailed pictorial view of the project.
